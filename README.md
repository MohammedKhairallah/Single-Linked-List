# Single-Linked-List

## Overview:

This project demonstrates the implementation of a single linked list in C programming language. A linked list is a fundamental data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes. Each node contains data and a reference (link) to the next node in the sequence. In a single linked list, each node points only to the next node in the sequence, forming a unidirectional chain.

## Features:

### Insertion Operations:

- Insert an element at the beginning of the list.
- Insert an element at the end of the list.
- Insert an element after a specific position in the list.

### Deletion Operations:

- Delete an element from the beginning of the list.
- Delete an element from a specific position in the list.

### Other Operations:

- Display all nodes in the list.
- Get the length of the list.
